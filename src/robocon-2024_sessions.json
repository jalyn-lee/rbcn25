    "Abstract": "Unlock the power of positive thinking in QA! Discover how our attention to detail can shape a happier, more productive life. Join us to shift from bug-chasers to solution-creators, fostering collaboration and celebrating success.",
    "Description": "Have you ever wondered how your career as a QA affects your life? We testers spend our time in detecting bugs, inconsistencies, and accessibility issues. We pay a lot of attention to details, try to think of scenarios not only on how to use the software, but how to abuse it too.  We are the gate-keepers for a new feature to be released. Is the new feature secure enough? Does it meet the requirements? We constantly seek for flaws and try negative scenarios. And by doing so, we become better and better at this. We train our eyes and our minds to see the flaws. In fact, we become too good at this. Our brain is a muscle; depending on the training we provide, the better we become at this.\r\n\r\nHave you ever considered how this training might affect the way we perceive the world in general outside the software?\r\nAll this negative thinking trains our brain to think negatively. And it does not stop when the clock ticks 5pm. This way of thinking, becomes the way we perceive the world around us. The way we interact with our colleagues, family or friends. The way we perceive challenges in life. Have you heard of the \u201cMedical students' disease\u201c? Is a condition frequently reported in medical students, who perceive themselves to be experiencing the symptoms of a disease that they are studying. The same happens to us, QA engineers, we constantly seek for flaws.\r\nAs Shawn Achor in the book \u201cThe Happiness advantage\u201d said: \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily the reality that shapes us, but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality.\u201d\r\n\r\nHow about reversing all this negative thinking? How about instead of chasing bugs, we prevent bugs from happening by thinking more positively?\r\n\r\nIf you can raise somebody\u2019s level of positivity in the present, then their brain experiences a happiness advantage. Your intelligence, your creativity and your energy levels rise.\r\nWe can turn our issues into opportunities. When raising an issue or writing a review, we can provide constructive feedback. Instead of focusing on the result, we can focus on the process and how we can improve our Way-Of-Working. It does not matter how many tickets we raise. What does matter, are the discussions being raised by asking the right questions, firing up discussions, documenting, searching and providing actions.\r\nInstead of testing the features being implemented by developers, think along with them while they develop; this way the product becomes more robust. We don\u2019t need to measure success in numbers. Sometimes more is achieved by doing less. Give the space and the time to enable others to do more.\r\n\r\nWe not only see the flaws but also the successes. We work closely with the developers and we see first the beautiful implementation they delivered, the solution they found, the way they handled a problem. There are often times I am proud of the people I am working with. We should be more vocal and praise our colleagues for what they achieved.\r\nLet's embrace the happiness advantage!",

Clean test management with test automation is the key to staying ahead in our business.   \r\n\r\nEfficient testing is a key success factor for fast and effective software development. We are facing the challenge of increasing test speed and repetition rate, as well as running tests in parallel. By running tests in the cloud, we are able to launch multiple solutions in different container instances in parallel, saving execution time. In combination with Jira as a test management tool and Jenkins as a starting point, we manage the test cases that will be executed and archive the results in an audit-compliant manner. Union Investment is a government-regulated company with mandatory guidelines to test traceability. Robot Framework provides exactly this. By using robot hooks developed for us by Imbus, we can log every step in detail. However, the current tools of Robot Framework cause some problems. The high complexity of the tests and the amount of information that needs to be logged makes the final report very confusing and unreadable for colleagues who aren't testers with Robot Framework knowledge but need to know the rough test flow and result.

    "Description": "Real-world projects serve as practical touchstones for theoretical concepts. Our current project, consisting of over 2500 lines of code and nearly 1000 lines of data, is still being developed. To ensure its sustainable growth without undue effort, we chose to adopt a meticulously structured approach.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nThankfully, Robot Framework, with its implementation of the keyword-driven testing concept, offers a wide variety of possibilities for structuring projects, be it the strict separation between human-readable test cases and their technically oriented implementations, importing data files in various formats, and the built-in differentiation of prerequisites of a test case and its implementation, to name the most useful ones.\r\n\r\nWith its mentioned features in mind, we have successfully implemented several concepts and best practices in our project. Key among them are:\r\n\r\n* the strict separation of static test data from test scripts into YAML files (but still retaining randomness of values where needed), not only promoting data reusability across different tests;\r\n* data-driven testing of similar scenarios notwithstanding different data items needed by them;\r\n* utilizing queries to obtain dynamic test data from a database system, maximizing bug discovery possibilities;\r\n* meeting the prerequisites of web tests through web services calls, vastly enhancing test preparation reliability and speed;\r\n* carefully chosen keyword names and interfaces, each with a distinct purpose, leading to diminished demands on their documentation;\r\n* a clear distinction between business keywords focused on human readability and technical keywords containing mainly implementation details; this, among others, enables people with limited technical backgrounds to assemble not only test cases but also some keywords.\r\n\r\nThis last point is of significant importance as it allows for the export of only the human-readable portions of a script into an issue-tracking system. This, in turn, enables manual execution of the script whenever needed, eliminating the need for dual maintenance of manual scripts alongside Robot Framework's automated ones.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to sharing our experiences, best practices, and tips for harnessing the full potential of not merely the highly structured approach inspired and enabled by Robot Framework's principles in a real-world project. Our goal is to inspire fellow professionals to explore the benefits of these techniques for enhancing their projects.",

    "Abstract": "Uncover the potential of Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) techniques in software testing. Discover how to use real-time network manipulation, empowering you with independence and flexibility in automation testing.",
    "Description": "# Introduction\r\nIn an ideal world, testing is straightforward, with every aspect of the system easily testable, automation seamless, and testing scenarios requiring no adjustments. The reality often falls short of this ideal. Testing environments may lack vital resources, leading to a reliance on developers to create stubs and mocks or manual testing.\r\nThis dependence on developers can introduce bottlenecks and dependencies, especially when working under time constraints or with uncooperative teams. What if testers could gain more control and independence in their testing scenarios? Let's explore the concept of using Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) techniques to revolutionize software testing.\r\n## The Pretend Game\r\nStubbing and mocking are established techniques in software testing. They involve manipulating specific parts of a test object to create specific testing scenarios. This is crucial when integration with external applications is impossible or when replicating desired behaviors is challenging.\r\nHowever, challenges arise when it comes to automation and parallel testing, as toggling a stub or mock on and off simultaneously is impossible.\r\n## Hacking your network: The MITM Approach\r\nMan-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks are well-known in the cybersecurity domain for eavesdropping network communications. However, MITM techniques can be harnessed as a potent tool for software testing. This approach gives testers the ability to take control of their testing scenarios without relying on developers, external resources, or making changes to the application under test.\r\nMITM offers several advantages:\r\n### Real-time Network Manipulation\r\nMITM allows testers to intercept and manipulate requests sent by applications, enabling the simulation of various scenarios. This can be done in parallel, by proxying a single browser instance to manipulate payloads, by delaying or even blocking specific endpoints.\r\n### Backend Information Manipulation\r\nMITM is a python library that provides testers with the ability to modify backend data, ensuring that the frontend displays the desired content for testing. Testers can use MITM to simulate various scenarios and verify how the application responds to different inputs. This powerful capability enhances test coverage and can help identify potential vulnerabilities faster\u00ac.\r\n## Versatility of MITM\r\nOne of the key strengths of MITM is its independence from the application under test. Testers can fully customize and utilize MITM according to their specific testing needs, without relying on external partners or introducing changes to the application's codebase. This versatility empowers testers to be more self-sufficient and flexible in their testing efforts.\r\n## Conclusion\r\nIn an imperfect world, software testing can be a daunting task, with dependencies on developers and external resources. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) techniques provides testers with the independence and flexibility they need to overcome these challenges.",

    "Abstract": "We will show how Robot Framework can be used in embedded software testing as a link between established tools and innovative solutions that make automating testing for hardware-related code a real possibility while still complying with regulatory requirements. Based on a practical solution, we examine if Robot Framework can unite both worlds",
    "Description": "Traditionally, testing each release of a microcontroller's firmware involves flashing it onto the chip, integrating it into a HIL simulation and testing it in a closed loop. To move away from this time-consuming way of testing embedded firmware, embeff developed the ExecutionPlatform. The ExecutionPlatform allows you to perform open-loop tests on your microcontroller that operate at the pin level, but without performing an entire simulation of the environment (as in system testing). The test specifies a pin behavior or calls functions in the code. As a result, functions in the code are read or the activities on the pins are evaluated. \r\n\r\nThese tests are written as Robot Framework scripts. They use Robot Keywords corresponding to the needed pins and endpoints the microcontroller sends and reads data from. After you have written your tests on your local machine, you can flash the firmware onto the chip and run the tests all via ethernet. \r\n\r\nAs firmware becomes more complex and regulatory requirements come into play, a test management tool is required to define and organise the test cases and align them with the requirements and standards. The established TestBench tool provides a modular approach with pre-defined macros for building test cases. It is also possible to generate and export Robot Framework scripts. They can be executed and immediately imported back into the database with the corresponding test results. \r\n\r\nThis can now be taken a step further with the ability to access, export and execute tests via a REST API call to the TestBench server. This could be triggered by a code change and an automatic build of the binary.",

    "Abstract": "Promoting re-usability and abstraction for a multi-interface telecommunication product. Employing one keyword per action offers consistent outputs across interfaces, versatile and reusable single-functionality tests and simplified user focus on keyword-based actions ensuring code simplicity.",
    "Description": "Microwave backhaul is a method used in telecommunications to transmit data, voice and other signals through radio frequencies. Our portfolio includes hardware units with diverse functionalities that can be flexibly configured to create various network/radio topologies. In addition to this, all units support the following user access interfaces: webct (web page), snmp and ongoing integration of netconf, REST and cli. Testing should cover frontend, backend, and end-to-end functionalities for each hardware unit, spanning all interfaces and multiple topological setups. In order to mitigate these complexity issues, we introduced an approach to overload keywords with custom python annotations. In this talk, we'll explore hardware testing challenges as well as our framework structure.\r\nThe most significant principles in our framework are: <br>\r\n\r\n\u2022\t**One Keyword Approach**\r\nEvery action on our product is associated with a specific keyword that will apply it to the access interface given as input argument. Since multi-interfaces are supported, it is ensured that each keyword will return consistent outputs.<br>\r\n\r\n\u2022\t**Test Reusability Across Interfaces**\r\nBy extending the above principle from keyword-level to testcase-level, we achieve test uniformity across interfaces, saving development time and resources otherwise spent on separate test case creation.<br>\r\n\r\n\u2022\t**Test Adaptability Based on Network Topology**\r\nProduct functionality should be tested across different hardware units and different network topologies. Tests designed for one network topology can be adjusted to similar topologies. The system-under-test is described in a Python class variable file with each test dynamically loading network parameters from this file during runtime. Changing the python file, reuses the test to another hw unit and topology.<br>\r\n\r\n\u2022\t**User Experience Simplification and Code Readability**\r\nTo enhance user focus on keyword-driven actions, common interface actions are hidden by adding interface-related parameters as function arguments. Python decorators facilitate these principles by mapping system-dependent variables to their values and executing required actions for each interface.<br>\r\n\r\n\u2022\t**Extendable to new interfaces**<br>\r\nSupport for new user interfaces can be incorporated just by implementing the interface python functions and due to one-keyword approach and test adaptability, no new tests need to be re-written to test existing functionality!<br>",

    "Description": "A model-based testing strategy is proposed, using BPMN models and some reference architecture specifications as input to generate RF scripts that automate a comprehensive User Acceptance Test procedure of a customizable PAIS.\r\nThe present PAIS, called AKIP Platform, is the result of the effort of researchers from the AgileKip group. It is based on the Open Source Community Edition Camunda 7, and uses JHipster to scaffold a fully customizable process-aware webapp.\r\nThe AKIP Platform was built by developers and researchers from the AgileKip group, who are devoted to facilitate Process/Workflow Automation initiatives based on code generation techniques, for developers, professors and researchers willing to disseminate and build Process-Aware Information Systems based on known technologies such as BPMN, Java and Javascript.\r\nLeveraging on RF, i.e. RPA, to mimic user interactions allows for reducing the need for testers to manually input PAIS-related information when handling user forms, while increasing test coverage and enabling regression testing.\r\nCurrently, there's a prototype developed, which is able to interpret the BPMN and generate executable test cases using RF for the user interface automation. It utilizes the Faker library to generate random input data and Selenium for the webapp automation.\r\nIt is also being explored the generation of such test cases using the Gherkin syntax, in an effort to aproximate documentation and test planning.",

The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.

It facilitates the creation of execution profiles for various environments, such as test, development, production, or CI.\r\n\r\n- **Efficient Querying of Project Information**: Developers can quickly identify which suites, tests, tasks, or tags are present in their project without the need for a complete test run or dry run. They can also experiment with different tag combinations and explore test cases associated with specific tags. This information can be easily displayed on the console and structured in a file for further processing.\r\n\r\n- **Enhancing Project Quality**: The RobotCode CLI Tools allow users to inspect their project for potential issues like typos, unknown keywords, imports, or variables. Furthermore, unused keywords or variables are detected, simplifying project-wide optimization. All diagnostic information displayed in the IDE is also available on the console.\r\n\r\n- **Optimizing Project Structure**: Developers can streamline their projects with RobotCode by removing unnecessary files or folders (i.e. the output folder). Additionally, they can generate new projects or files from pre-defined or custom templates.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial is for developers who want to optimize their use of Robot Framework with the advanced features of RobotCode.

I harnessed the power of Robot Framework and suggested to Automate the queries and we call it Data Quality Controls.\r\n\r\nWe used Robot Framework and Automated 2000+ Controls and this serves as entry and exit checkpoints at each Business level. These Data Quality Controls run every month to ensure accuracy, completeness, consistency, validity and no wrong data is supplied to the DownStream system.\r\n\r\nFramework Architecture:\r\nWe build a Hybrid Test Automation Framework with Page Object Model, combined with Keyword and Data Driven Architecture to cater our needs.\r\n\r\nTech Stack: Hadoop, HDFS, Oracle, Unix and Python\r\nTest Automation: Robot Framework with Python\r\n\r\nSavings:\r\nThe Quality Control Validations which were previous performed by Business Users for weeks to months, got reduced to less than a Day's effort. We saved over 5000+ Person Days over the years.\r\n\r\nOther Information:\r\nClient Details: \r\nThe client is one of the top Banks in Nordics. The Bank has its presence wide spread across Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway and Poland.\r\n\r\nProject Description:\r\nThe project is a regulatory compliance project for the Bank.\r\n\r\nAbout Me:\r\nI am an Automation Solution Architect and Automation Consultant with 12+Years of Experience, working for One of Top Global Tech Company- Tata Consultancy Services.

Addressing and maintaining all these libraries became, over time, a real challenge.\r\nMoreover, building an end-to-end test solution with all these various tools turned out to be very complex and sometimes impossible, leading to a lot of manual test campaigns.\r\nIn this presentation we will show you how Robot Framework was a game changer for us as we started to automate in a much effective way, embracing the diversity of our technologies in a smooth way.\r\nWe will highlight:\r\n- how by designing python library templates, we now have a common way of developing our business specific keywords libraries providing guidelines without affecting flexibility and without forcing users to a strict model,\r\n- how our framework is based on standard keywords to send messages through the different protocols used for testing,\r\n- how the defined templates are easily adaptable to small and large products,\r\n- how we promote a standard model for the keyword documentation, and we centralize all the testing libraries documentation in one single place to ease the sharing,\r\n- and finally, how this model is compatible with our new Cloud Native Applications",

The entire software development process, starting with the creation of requirements and ending with the release of tests, is carried out decentrally in the respective teams. For this reason, various automation solutions have become established in our group.\r\nWe were commissioned about two years ago to unify the test automation process and develop a test automation strategy. Our journey began with the evaluation of various test tools and the comparison of different approaches to test automation. One of the challenges for a test automation solution was that software tests should be able to be automated by a wide range of users, even without development knowledge. In our talk we would like to review our project with you and visualise how we created a scalable test automation kit with Robot Framework.

The key innovation is that only information visible in the user interface is needed. This is in stark contrast to existing solutions, which rely on the low-level structure of the GUI, resulting in cryptic automation scripts. In order to empower domain experts around the world, RoboSAPiens is designed to be translatable. Currently, keywords are available in English and German.\r\n\r\nThis talk provides a short tutorial to get started using RoboSAPiens. After the installation and setup, different keywords will be showcased in a live demo. Along the way tips and tricks for automating the SAP GUI will be shared. There will also be some anecdotes from RoboSAPiens in the wild.\r\n\r\nRoboSAPiens was initially developed by imbus as an internal project at NRW.Bank (the state development bank of the federal state of North Rhein-Westphalia in Germany). Due to its positive impact on the efficiency of quality assurance tasks, the bank decided to make it available to the world as open-source software. imbus continues the development of RoboSAPiens.

    "Description": "We will take you along the ride during the course of seven years where we implemented Robot Framework in different environments at different clients. During this period, we ran into many challenges of which we are sure most of the attendees have already ran, or will run into sooner or later. \r\n\r\nOur journey started when our team responsible for test management in a large organisation decided Robot framework was the tool to help them to implement test automation within the organisation.\r\n\r\nAs so often in this situation, we started with one team that needed testcases for a web application. But, after a few months of success, problems start to occur with re-using parts of the scripts, maintainability and of course, the ever-expending universe of applications to test and the platforms they work on. Our solution? An architecture that puts keywords in segregated resource-files which is backed-up by straight forward and easy to apply rules that prevents ambiguous keywords and increases maintainability. \r\n\r\nBut a good architecture doesn\u2019t stop there. As our journey continuous, stakeholders want to get a grip on what is tested. The organization wants to use the framework across all the teams and use it for end-to-end testing of the most critical processes. Just a good technical architecture doesn\u2019t cut it here. Aggregation is needed and we needed to enhance the readability of the testscripts even further in order to enable collaboration between development teams and their stakeholders. We will tell you which additions to our architecture we came up with to answer these questions.\r\n\r\nOf course, as in every modern environment where software is created, pipelines and code repositories are supported and facilitated by the architecture, and we will briefly take a look at this as well.\r\n\r\nSince the first design of our architecture, we\u2019ve used this as a basis for several clients. As every environment comes with its own challenges, we found the basis of the architecture very reliable and with some tweaking here and there it never seems to let us down. So, join us for the ride and see if we can inspire you to face your own challenges with our architecture.",

    "Lessons Learned": "The talk highlights the challenge of transitioning from on-premises solutions like Jenkins and Bitbucket to a cloud-based solution like GitHub Actions.\r\nThe lesson learned here is that organizations need to adapt to changing technologies and consider cloud solutions for more flexibility and scalability. As well as creation of separate actions for various testing steps, such as environment preparation, test execution, and result import into Jira. This approach allows for better organization and reuse of actions.\r\nMain approach is to break down complex processes into manageable steps, making them more maintainable and shareable.\r\nPart of this solution is displaying an extract directly in the GitHub Job Summary and Integrating test results into Jira, specifically using Xray for reporting.",

    "Abstract": "Are developers able to write automated tests and should they do it? And if so, in what sense, in which areas, and to what extent? Let us take a closer look at the symbiosis of developers and test automation specialists and explore why keeping they roles separate is the key to unlocking the potential of a testing process.",
    "Description": "In software development, the question of the developer's role in automated testing and that of the test automation specialist in development occasionally arises. We will take a thought-provoking look at this complex relationship in our talk.\r\n\r\nThis question considers the overlap and similarities between their personalities and roles; however, differences do exist. While developers may possess the technical ability to create functional automated tests, test automation encompasses more than merely writing automatic tests, just as development involves more than coding an application. The skill sets of the two groups differ significantly: developers require extensive technical knowledge, while testers need to empathise with users or customers, understanding their needs and behaviour, business processes, and use cases. They require different mindsets: technically oriented versus customer-oriented, constructive versus critical, and synthetic versus analytical. (It is no coincidence that developers tend to focus on positive, happy-day scenarios, whereas testers usually discover negative ones.) \r\n\r\nIt is therefore difficult to envisage a centaur, part tester and part developer, possessing these contrasting skills and mindsets. What is beyond imagination is this creature not being overwhelmed by its workload and receiving fair remuneration. However, the attitudes and skills of both developers and TA specialists are critical to the development of high-quality software, and thus not only performing tasks of the ones and the others but also maintaining a clear distinction between these two groups appears to be vital. Their collaboration is undoubtedly essential and, fortunately, also feasible as long as both parties strive to understand each other's inherently different personalities and attitudes while respecting each other's expertise. Their shared focus on a common goal and areas of their knowledge that overlap can also be immensely beneficial.\r\n\r\nJoin us as we explore the intricacies of these fascinating species, find the optimal way for them to collaborate symbiotically, and consider how their interplay can enhance both your development process and its outcomes.",

    "Description": "<p>REST APIs are a common and attractive attack vector. Often they lack sufficient security design or security testing. It is common to rely a bit too much on client-side sanitization while neglecting the idea of direct API usage. This can cause a lot of security issues, like sensitive data exposure, broken authentication, and injection attacks. </p>\r\n <p>So, how can we make sure an API cannot be exploited? The answer is to fuzz it. In this talk, you learn about Vaisala's experience of integrating API fuzzing - a form of security testing - into an existing Robot Framework system test automation process for one of company products. </p> \r\n<p>We selected a third-party tool (Schemathesis, which builds on the property-based testing library Hypothesis) and implemented a Python package with post-processing functionality that allows us to effectively run fuzzing against our APIs. This Python package is then imported and used in RF test cases. </p> \r\n<p>Since fuzzing can generate a lot of noise, because of its randomness, the post-processing step can validate the meaning of symptoms and help us make sense of test results better by integrating with existing robot framework automation assets. So when a bug is found with fuzzing, we can rerun the faulty test, and run any system checks we need, which will tell us what exactly is broken. </p>\r\n <p>Overall, the talk explains how REST API fuzzing can be effectively integrated with existing RF tests, and shows examples of found problems.</p>",

Robot Framework is a tool that you already know and use, so I will not spend time explaining what it is or how it works. Instead, I will focus on the challenges and benefits of introducing it as a main end-to-end testing tool in your workplace.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nThe workshop will be divided into 7 time blocks (give-or-take), each focusing on a different topic or theme related to introducing Robot Framework in an organization. The topics will include:\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n- Why Robot Framework should be used? What are its pros and cons and how does it compare to other tools?\r\n- Where can Robot Framework be used? Where cannot it be used?\r\n- What do developers and testers prefer to Robot Framework and why?\r\n- How can introduction be approached? What are the best practices and pitfalls to avoid?\r\n- How can Robot Framework be integrated with other tools, such as Selenium, BrowserStack, or Jenkins?\r\n- How can Robot Framework be used for different types of testing, such as acceptance testing, functional testing, or performance testing?\r\n\r\nThe workshop will use a combination of theory and practice, with an emphasis on discussion and collaboration. I hope to pass on my experience, and at the same time - learn from You. \r\n\r\nWe will also be:\r\n\r\n- Playing games, such as risk storming with test sphere card game or the pipeline game, that will help you explore different aspects of introducing Robot Framework in an organization, such as identifying the quality aspects, the risks, the test strategies, and the pipeline design.\r\n- Role-playing scenarios, such as convincing a skeptical manager or developer to adopt Robot Framework, that will help you practice your communication and persuasion skills and understand the opinions and preferences of others.\r\n- Authoring a documentation as a guide for future technical experts, that will help you summarize and document the main points and outcomes of the workshop.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will be driven by its participants, so the topics can vary slightly, but you're more than welcome to bring your ideas and experience to the table!",
